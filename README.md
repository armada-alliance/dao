_**Armada Alliance Decentralized Autonomous Organization**_

## What is the Armada DAO?

The Armada Alliance is a community of Cardano stake pool operators, delegators, creators, developers, and advocates.&#x20; With a shared belief in true decentralization, open-source collaboration, and self-reliance.&#x20;

As a community we have grown and continue to grow day after day, this means we have become a sort of global organization but need some management of our many projects and future endeavors.&#x20; 

Thus, it is why we are forming the Armada decentralized autonomous organization or Armada DAO in order to maintain true to our beliefs and ensure a trustless democratic system to help manage the Armada Alliance.&#x20; The Armada DAO will apply this shared logic and ethical belief system by utilizing 3rd generation blockchain technology like Cardano and its smart contract platform to help with various management of services.&#x20;
