# ðŸ’° Delegation

## Armada Alliance Investing Schedule Proposal

### Introduction

Before we begin, I want to inform the reader that this is just a rough outline of the proposal and is actively being worked on.&#x20;

This proposal is intended to help develop a sustainable and fair treasury delegation model for the Armada Alliance and its members.&#x20; You may ask what is the alliance treasury delegation model? And why is this important to the alliance?&#x20;

We at the Armada Alliance have decided to take on the challenge of getting small pools their first blocks, increasing active stake, and meeting pledge requirements for IOG and Cardano Foundation.&#x20; In order to do this, we have decided to create our own fund or treasury that will be used to delegate to our alliance pools in a fair and meaningful way.&#x20;

### Methodology

1. Create an alliance treasury in the form of a Plutus smart contract to delegate ADA to members. Each alliance member should delegate a certain amount of ADA, min 100 ADA, into the smart contract.
2. Determine the pool(s) that gets funding for the current round. Listed below are some ways to determine the pool(s) to be selected.
   * Voting selection: Vote by using a poll or by using utility tokens that we will mint and use in our own internal voting webApp.
   * Random Weighted Probability Selection:
   *
3. Stake the fund in a chosen pool for 6 epochs.
4. If the contract is not canceled or made void, repeat steps 1-3. Otherwise, draft a new contract.
